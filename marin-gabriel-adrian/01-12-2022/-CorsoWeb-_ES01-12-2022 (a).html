        <h3>What Is Chess?</h3>
        <p>
            Chess is a board game played between two players that simulates a war between two kingdoms. It is one of the
            most popular games in the world. Millions of people play it both recreationally and competitively.

        <article id="Pawn">
            <h2>The Pawn</h2>
            <img

            <p>
                A pawn is the most common chess piece on the chessboard. Chess sets contain sixteen total pawns. Each
                player begins the game with eight pawns set up on the second rank directly in front of the major pieces:
                rooks, bishops, knights, queen, and king.
            </p>

        <article id="Rook">
            <h2>The Rook</h2>
            <img
                src="https://images.ctfassets.net/3s5io6mnxfqz/4G0nzW4Ph5qfwIg24JUmuF/1ffb322d90a23f9efd88cf764538e67a/AdobeStock_327334787.jpeg">
            <p>
                In terms of relative value, a rook is considered a major piece. Its normally valued at five pawns, two
                pawns more than a bishop or knight (considered minor pieces) and slightly less than two bishops or two
                knights. Two rooks are considered slightly stronger (by one pawn) than a single queen. In fact, after
                the queen, its the most valuable non-king piece in the board game.

        <article id="Knight">
            <h2>The Knight</h2>
            <img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/article/16862.a7edc4c8.668x375o.c80e913dbba7@2x.jpeg">
            <p>
                A knight is a piece in the game of chess that is traditionally shaped like a horse. Each player begins
                the chess game with two knights. When setting up your chess set, place the knights on the row closest to
                each player, between the bishop and the rook.

        <article id="Bishop">
            <h2>The Bishop</h2>
            <img
                src="https://images.ctfassets.net/3s5io6mnxfqz/32QoTfyChoDW77M5lflajM/8c2a9d27347ffb44341fb2232f4cdfd7/AdobeStock_58956658.jpeg">
            <p>
                A bishop is a chess piece with a rounded top and a slit cut into it. There are four total bishops on a
                chess board, with each player allocated two pieces. The kingside bishop is placed between the king and
                knight on the row closest to each player on the chess set, while the queenside bishop rests between the
                knight and the queen.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article id="Queen">
            <h2>The Queen</h2>
            <img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/article/24876.b9db3b03.5000x5000o.27d27bb80d90.jpeg">
            <p>
                The modern queen is the most valuable piece, and a key component in countless strategies. In material
                terms, its equivalent to three minor pieces, nearly as valuable as both rooks, and more valuable than
                every one of your pawns. For this reason, its nearly always a bad trade to exchange your queen for
                another piece except in certain extraordinary situations.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article id="King">
            <h2>The King</h2>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/49/7a/f1/497af111cd48bf5000c50a08d9c4211d.jpg">
            <p>
                Like the queen, the king can move in any direction. That said, it can only move one square at a time.
                This might seem to make the king one of the more versatile chess pieces, but there s a major exception:
                According to the rules of chess, the king can never move into a square that s being attacked by an
                opponent s piece.
